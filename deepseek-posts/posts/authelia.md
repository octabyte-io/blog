## What is Authelia?

Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server designed to secure access to applications and services. It acts as a **reverse proxy**, sitting between users and your applications, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access your resources. With features like **MFA**, **SSO**, and **fine-grained access control**, Authelia is a powerful tool for enhancing your organization’s security.

### Key Features of Authelia:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Supports multiple authentication methods, including TOTP, U2F, and push notifications.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allows users to log in once and access multiple applications without re-entering credentials.
- **Access Control Policies:** Define granular access rules based on user roles, IP addresses, and more.
- **Open Source:** Completely free and open-source, with a vibrant community contributing to its development.
- **Easy Integration:** Works seamlessly with popular reverse proxies like Nginx, Traefik, and HAProxy.
- **Self-Hosted:** Gives you full control over your authentication infrastructure.

## Why Choose Authelia?

### 1. **Enhanced Security with MFA**
Authelia’s MFA capabilities ensure that even if a user’s password is compromised, an additional layer of security protects their account. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

### 2. **Simplified User Experience with SSO**
With SSO, users only need to log in once to access multiple applications. This not only improves user experience but also reduces the risk of password fatigue and weak password practices.

### 3. **Flexible Access Control**
Authelia allows you to define access control policies tailored to your organization’s needs. Whether you want to restrict access based on user roles, IP addresses, or time of day, Authelia has you covered.

### 4. **Open Source and Self-Hosted**
As an open-source solution, Authelia gives you complete control over your authentication infrastructure. You can host it on your own servers, ensuring compliance with your organization’s security policies.
