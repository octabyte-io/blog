## Introduction to FerretDB

FerretDB is an open-source database that provides a MongoDB-compatible interface, making it an excellent alternative for developers who want to leverage MongoDB’s flexibility without being locked into a proprietary ecosystem. Built on top of PostgreSQL, FerretDB combines the best of both worlds: the document-oriented features of MongoDB and the reliability of PostgreSQL.

With FerretDB, developers can use their existing MongoDB tools and libraries while benefiting from the robustness and scalability of PostgreSQL. This makes FerretDB a compelling choice for modern applications that require a flexible, scalable, and open-source database solution.
