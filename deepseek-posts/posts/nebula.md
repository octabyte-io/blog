## Why Choose Nebula Over Other Networking Tools?

While there are several overlay networking tools available, Nebula stands out due to its simplicity, security, and scalability. Let’s compare Nebula with two other popular tools: **WireGuard** and **Tailscale**.

| Feature                | Nebula                          | WireGuard                      | Tailscale                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**        | Easy to configure with a single file | Requires manual setup for each peer | Fully managed, easy to set up |
| **Encryption**         | End-to-end encryption           | End-to-end encryption           | End-to-end encryption          |
| **Scalability**        | Highly scalable                 | Scalable but requires manual effort | Highly scalable               |
| **Zero-Trust Model**   | Yes                             | No                              | Yes                            |
| **Cross-Platform**     | Yes                             | Yes                             | Yes                            |
| **Built-in Discovery** | Yes (Lighthouse)                | No                              | Yes                            |
| **Open Source**        | Yes                             | Yes                             | No (freemium model)            |

### Nebula vs WireGuard

- **Ease of Use:** Nebula’s single configuration file makes it easier to set up compared to WireGuard, which requires manual configuration for each peer.
- **Discovery:** Nebula’s built-in Lighthouse simplifies device discovery, whereas WireGuard lacks this feature, requiring additional tools for discovery.
- **Zero-Trust Model:** Nebula enforces a zero-trust model, while WireGuard relies on manual key management.

### Nebula vs Tailscale

- **Open Source:** Nebula is fully open-source, giving you complete control over your network. Tailscale, while based on WireGuard, is a proprietary service with a freemium model.
- **Customization:** Nebula allows for more customization and control compared to Tailscale, which is more of a managed service.
- **Cost:** Nebula is free to use, while Tailscale charges for advanced features and larger networks.
