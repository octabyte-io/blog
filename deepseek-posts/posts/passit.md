This is where **Passit**, an open-source password manager, comes to the rescue. In this blog post, we'll explore how Passit can help you secure your digital life, its standout features, and how it compares to other popular password managers.

## What is Passit?

Passit is an open-source password manager designed to help you store and manage your passwords securely.

With Passit, you only need to remember one master password to access all your other passwords.

### Key Features of Passit
