## What is Healthchecks?

Healthchecks.io is a lightweight yet robust service that monitors your cron jobs and scheduled tasks. It works by sending periodic "pings" to Healthchecks to confirm that your tasks are running as expected. If a ping is missed or delayed, Healthchecks sends you an alert via email, SMS, Slack, or other integrations, allowing you to take immediate action.

### Key Features of Healthchecks:
- **Simple Integration:** Easily integrate with your existing cron jobs using a simple HTTP-based API.
- **Multi-Channel Alerts:** Receive notifications via email, SMS, Slack, Discord, and more.
- **Open Source:** Healthchecks is open-source, meaning you can self-host it if needed.
- **Customizable Checks:** Set up custom intervals and grace periods for each cron job.
- **Detailed Logs:** Track the history of pings and alerts for better debugging.
- **Team Collaboration:** Share monitoring responsibilities with your team members.

3. **Cost-Effective:** Healthchecks offers a free tier for basic usage, making it accessible for small teams and startups.

## How Does Healthchecks Work?

1. **Create a Check:** Sign up on Healthchecks.io and create a new check. You’ll get a unique URL for pinging.
2. **Integrate with Cron Jobs:** Add a curl command or HTTP request to your cron job script to ping the Healthchecks URL.
3. **Set Alerts:** Configure notification channels (email, Slack, etc.) to receive alerts if a ping is missed.
4. **Monitor and Debug:** Use the Healthchecks dashboard to monitor the status of your cron jobs and review logs.

Example of a cron job with Healthchecks integration:
```bash
# Run a backup script every day at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh && curl -fsS --retry 3 https://hc-ping.com/your-unique-check-id > /dev/null
```
