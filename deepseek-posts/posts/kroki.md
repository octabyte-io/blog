## How Kroki Works

Kroki works by taking diagram descriptions written in plain text (e.g., PlantUML syntax) and converting them into visual diagrams. Here’s a quick example:

```plaintext
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob --> Alice: I'm good, thanks!
@enduml
```

When you send this text to Kroki’s API, it generates a diagram like this:

Kroki supports over 20 diagram types, making it a versatile tool for all your diagramming needs.
