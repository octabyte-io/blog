Open Journal Systems (OJS) is an open-source software platform designed to streamline the management and publishing of scholarly journals. Developed by the Public Knowledge Project (PKP), OJS is widely used by academic institutions, researchers, and publishers to handle peer-reviewed journals, editorial workflows, and online publishing. With OJS, you can manage submissions, peer reviews, editorial processes, and publishing—all in one place.
