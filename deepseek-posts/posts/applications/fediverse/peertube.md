## What is PeerTube?

PeerTube is a decentralized, open-source video hosting platform that allows users to share and stream videos without relying on centralized services like YouTube. Built on ActivityPub, PeerTube enables users to create their own video-sharing instances while connecting with other instances in a federated network. This ensures greater privacy, control, and freedom for content creators and viewers alike.

PeerTube is an excellent alternative for those looking to break free from the limitations and algorithms of traditional video platforms. It’s ideal for businesses, educators, and creators who want to host their own video content while maintaining full ownership and control.
