## What is Password Pusher?

Password Pusher is an open-source tool designed to securely share passwords and sensitive information. Instead of sending passwords via email or messaging apps, which can be risky, Password Pusher allows you to share a link that expires after a set time or after the password is viewed. This ensures that sensitive data is transmitted securely and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

### Why is Password Pusher Useful?

- **Enhanced Security:** Passwords are shared via encrypted links that expire, reducing the risk of interception or misuse.
- **Convenience:** No need to remember complex passwords or rely on insecure communication channels.
- **Audit Trail:** Track when and by whom the password was accessed, ensuring accountability.
- **Open-Source Flexibility:** Customize and extend Password Pusher to meet your specific needs.
