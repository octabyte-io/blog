## What is Strapi?

Strapi is an open-source, headless CMS that provides developers with the tools to create, manage, and deliver content across multiple platforms. Unlike traditional CMS platforms, Strapi is **headless**, meaning it separates the backend (content management) from the frontend (content presentation). This architecture allows developers to use any frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) to build dynamic, modern websites and applications.

Strapi is built on **Node.js**, making it lightweight, fast, and highly customizable. It’s designed to be developer-friendly, offering a rich set of features out of the box while allowing for extensive customization through plugins and APIs.
