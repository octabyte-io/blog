## What is CryptPad?  

CryptPad is an open-source, privacy-first collaboration platform that allows users to create and share documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and more—all with end-to-end encryption. Unlike traditional collaboration tools, CryptPad ensures that only you and your collaborators can access your data. Even the server hosting your files cannot decrypt your content.  

Developed with a focus on security and user privacy, CryptPad is an excellent alternative to mainstream tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365, especially for those who prioritize data sovereignty and confidentiality.

## Key Features of CryptPad  

1. **End-to-End Encryption**  
   Every document, spreadsheet, or presentation created on CryptPad is encrypted before it leaves your device. This means only you and the people you share the document with can access its contents.

   CryptPad allows users to collaborate without creating an account. Simply share a link, and your collaborators can start working immediately.  

4. **Open-Source and Self-Hostable**  
   CryptPad’s code is open-source, meaning you can audit it, modify it, or even host it on your own server for complete control over your data.  

5. **Multiple Document Types**  
   CryptPad supports a variety of document types, including:  
   - Rich text documents  
   - Spreadsheets  
   - Kanban boards
