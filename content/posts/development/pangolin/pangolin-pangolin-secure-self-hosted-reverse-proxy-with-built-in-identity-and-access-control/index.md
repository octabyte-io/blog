# Pangolin – Secure Self-Hosted Reverse Proxy with Identity and Access Control

Managing secure access to internal applications has always been a challenge for developers, sysadmins, and DevOps teams. Enter **Pangolin** – a secure, self-hosted reverse proxy that comes with **built-in Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.

Whether you're looking to protect internal dashboards, developer tools, or SaaS applications, Pangolin offers a modern, efficient, and privacy-focused solution.

## 🚀 What is Pangolin?

**Pangolin** is an **open-source reverse proxy** built with a security-first mindset. Unlike traditional reverse proxies that rely on external tools for authentication and authorization, Pangolin integrates these capabilities natively.

### 🔑 Key Features

- 🔐 Built-in Authentication (Google, GitHub, OIDC, SAML, LDAP, etc.)
- 🛡️ Access Control Rules (per app, user, group, etc.)
- 🖥️ Modern Web UI for configuration
- 🧠 Single Sign-On (SSO) support
- 🌍 Self-hosted – full control over your data
- 📦 Lightweight and Docker-ready

---

## 🧩 Why Choose Pangolin?

Setting up identity and access management across multiple services often requires complex integrations. Pangolin simplifies this by **bringing identity directly into the proxy**.

### Perfect for:

- Internal tools like Grafana, Prometheus, Jenkins, etc.
- Admin dashboards and internal SaaS portals
- Microservices needing centralized access control
- Teams requiring SSO and audit logging

---

## 🏗️ How Pangolin Works

Pangolin sits in front of your services as a **reverse proxy with identity-aware access**. Users are prompted to authenticate, and access is granted based on your configuration.
