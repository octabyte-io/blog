### Key Features of LibreTranslate

## Why Choose LibreTranslate?

### 1. **Privacy & Security**
Unlike popular translation services like Google Translate or Microsoft Translator, LibreTranslate allows you to self-host the service. This means your data never leaves your server, making it an ideal choice for businesses handling sensitive information.

### 2. **Cost-Effective**
LibreTranslate is completely free to use, with no subscription fees or hidden costs. You only need to cover the server hosting expenses, which are minimal compared to proprietary solutions.

### 3. **Customization**
With LibreTranslate, you can train your own translation models or fine-tune existing ones to improve accuracy for specific domains or languages. This level of customization is not possible with most commercial translation tools.

### 4. **Open Source Community**
Being open-source, LibreTranslate benefits from a vibrant community of developers who continuously improve the software. You can contribute to the project, report issues, or request new features.
