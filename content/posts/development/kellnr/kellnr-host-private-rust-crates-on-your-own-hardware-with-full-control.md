## Introduction

Rust has rapidly gained popularity among developers for its performance, safety, and modern tooling. One of the key components of Rust's ecosystem is **Cargo**, the package manager that simplifies dependency management. While [crates.io](https://crates.io) is the default registry for public Rust crates, many organizations need to host private crates for proprietary or internal projects. This is where **Kellnr** comes in.

Kellnr is an open source, self-hosted solution for managing private Rust crates. It gives you full control over your Rust dependencies, allowing you to host crates on your own hardware while maintaining security and compliance. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Kellnr is, its key features, and how it compares to other crate hosting solutions.
