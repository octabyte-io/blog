## 🚀 What is MeshCommander?

**MeshCommander** is an open-source tool designed to manage devices equipped with **Intel® AMT** — a feature found in many Intel vPro systems. It allows IT admins to:

Unlike traditional remote access tools, MeshCommander operates independently of the operating system, giving you **true out-of-band control**.
