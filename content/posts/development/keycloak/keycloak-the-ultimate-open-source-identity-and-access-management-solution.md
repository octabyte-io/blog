## What is Keycloak?

Keycloak is an open-source IAM platform developed by Red Hat.

Keycloak is designed to be highly customizable, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from small startups to large enterprises.

## Why Choose Keycloak?

Here are some of the key reasons why Keycloak stands out as a top choice for IAM:

### 1. **Open-Source and Free**  
Keycloak is completely open-source, meaning you can use it without worrying about licensing costs. This makes it an attractive option for businesses looking to reduce expenses while maintaining robust security.

### 2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
Keycloak enables users to log in once and access multiple applications without needing to re-enter credentials. This improves user experience and reduces password fatigue.

### 3. **User Federation**  
Keycloak allows you to integrate with existing user directories, such as LDAP or Active Directory, making it easy to manage users across systems.

### 4. **Social Login and Identity Brokering**  
With Keycloak, users can log in using their social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook) or through third-party identity providers like Okta or Auth0.

### 5. **Customizable and Extensible**  
Keycloak’s modular architecture allows developers to extend its functionality to meet specific business needs.

### 6. **Secure and Scalable**  
Keycloak supports industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML 2.0, ensuring secure authentication and authorization. It’s also designed to scale with your business.
