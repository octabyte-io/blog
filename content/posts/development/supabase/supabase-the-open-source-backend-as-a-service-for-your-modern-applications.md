## What is Supabase?

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, designed to provide developers with a fully managed backend infrastructure. It combines the power of **PostgreSQL**, a robust relational database, with a suite of tools that simplify backend development. With Supabase, you get features like:

- **Realtime Database:** Built on PostgreSQL, Supabase offers realtime capabilities, allowing you to sync data across clients instantly.
- **Authentication:** Easily integrate user authentication with support for email/password, social logins, and more.
- **Storage:** Store and serve files with ease using Supabase’s built-in storage solution.

PostgreSQL is one of the most advanced open-source relational databases. By leveraging PostgreSQL, Supabase offers powerful features like JSONB support, full-text search, and ACID compliance.

### 3. **Realtime Capabilities**
Supabase’s realtime functionality is powered by PostgreSQL’s `LISTEN/NOTIFY` system, making it easy to build applications that require live updates, such as chat apps or collaborative tools.

### 4. **Developer-Friendly**
Supabase provides a simple and intuitive interface, along with detailed documentation and SDKs for popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Flutter.
