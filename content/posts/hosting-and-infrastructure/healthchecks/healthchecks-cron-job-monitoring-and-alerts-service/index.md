## What is Healthchecks?

Healthchecks.io is a lightweight yet robust service that monitors your cron jobs and scheduled tasks.

- **Simple Integration:** Easily integrate with your existing cron jobs using a simple HTTP-based API.
- **Multi-Channel Alerts:** Receive notifications via email, SMS, Slack, Discord, and more.
