## Why Choose Immich Over Google Photos?

While Google Photos is a convenient option, it comes with limitations and concerns:
- **Privacy:** Google Photos stores your data on their servers, raising privacy concerns.
- **Cost:** Free storage is limited, and high-resolution photos require a paid subscription.
- **Data Ownership:** You don’t fully own or control your data.

Immich addresses these issues by offering a self-hosted solution that puts you in control. Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature                | Immich                          | Google Photos                   |
