In the world of SaaS businesses, billing is a critical component that can make or break your revenue operations. While platforms like Stripe Billing and Chargebee have dominated the market, they often come with limitations, especially for businesses with complex, usage-based billing models. Enter **Lago**, the open-source alternative that’s redefining how SaaS companies handle billing.

In this blog post, we’ll dive deep into what makes Lago a game-changer, how it compares to Stripe Billing and Chargebee, and why it’s the perfect choice for businesses looking for flexibility, transparency, and cost-effectiveness.

## Why Choose Lago Over Stripe Billing and Chargebee?

While Stripe Billing and Chargebee are excellent tools, they may not be the best fit for every business. Here’s why Lago stands out:

### 1. **Open-Source Flexibility**
Lago’s open-source nature allows you to customize the platform to meet your exact needs. Unlike Stripe and Chargebee, which operate as black boxes, Lago gives you full visibility into your billing logic.

### 2. **Cost-Effectiveness**
Stripe and Chargebee charge a percentage of your revenue, which can add up quickly. With Lago, you only pay for the infrastructure you use, making it a more affordable option for growing businesses.

### 3. **Usage-Based Billing Made Easy**
Lago is specifically designed for usage-based billing, making it ideal for SaaS companies with variable pricing models. Stripe and Chargebee can handle usage-based billing, but their implementations are often more complex and less flexible.

### 4. **Data Ownership**
With Lago, you own your data. This is a significant advantage over proprietary solutions, where your data is stored on third-party servers.
