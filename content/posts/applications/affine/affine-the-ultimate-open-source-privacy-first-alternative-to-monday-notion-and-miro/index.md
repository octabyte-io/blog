## Why Choose Affine Over Monday, Notion, and Miro?

While Monday, Notion, and Miro are excellent tools, they come with certain limitations that Affine addresses head-on:

4. **All-in-One Solution**: Affine combines the best features of Monday (task management), Notion (document collaboration), and Miro (visual brainstorming) into a single, cohesive platform.
