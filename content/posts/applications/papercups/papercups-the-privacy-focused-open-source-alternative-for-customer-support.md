## Why Choose Papercups?

### 1. **Privacy and Security**
Unlike many proprietary customer support tools, Papercups is designed with privacy in mind. Since it’s open-source, you can host it on your own servers, ensuring complete control over your data. This is especially important for businesses in regulated industries or those handling sensitive customer information.
