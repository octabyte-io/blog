## What is BTCPay?

BTCPay is an open-source cryptocurrency payment processor that enables businesses to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly, without intermediaries. It was created in 2017 as an alternative to centralized payment processors like BitPay, offering more control, privacy, and flexibility to users.

Unlike traditional payment processors, BTCPay is **self-hosted**, meaning you can run it on your own server. This eliminates the need for third-party services, reducing fees and giving you full control over your funds and data.
