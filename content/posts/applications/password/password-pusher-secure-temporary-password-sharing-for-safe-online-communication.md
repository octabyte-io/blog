## What is Password Pusher?

[Password Pusher](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher) is an open-source application that allows users to share passwords and other sensitive information securely. Instead of sending passwords via email, chat, or other insecure channels, Password Pusher generates a unique, time-limited link that can be shared with the intended recipient. Once the link is accessed or expires, the password is automatically deleted, ensuring it doesn’t linger in insecure environments.

### Key Features of Password Pusher:
- **Temporary Sharing:** Passwords are automatically deleted after a set period or after being viewed.
- **No Storage:** Passwords are not stored permanently, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Customizable Expiry:** Set expiration times for links (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, or after the first view).
- **Open-Source:** Fully transparent and customizable, making it ideal for businesses with specific security needs.
- **Self-Hosted:** Deploy it on your own server for complete control over your data.

## Why Use Password Pusher?

### 1. **Enhanced Security**
Traditional methods of sharing passwords, such as email or messaging apps, are inherently insecure. Password Pusher eliminates this risk by ensuring that passwords are shared via encrypted links and automatically deleted after use.

### 2. **Temporary Access**
With Password Pusher, you can set expiration times for shared passwords. This ensures that even if a link is intercepted, it won’t be usable after the specified time.

### 3. **No Permanent Storage**
Unlike password managers that store passwords indefinitely, Password Pusher doesn’t retain any data after the link expires. This minimizes the risk of data breaches.

### 4. **Open-Source Flexibility**
Being open-source, Password Pusher can be customized to meet specific business requirements. You can audit the code, add features, or integrate it with other tools.
