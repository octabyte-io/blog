## Why Choose SearXNG Over Traditional Search Engines?

Traditional search engines like Google and Bing are designed to collect user data for advertising and analytics. This often compromises user privacy. SearXNG, on the other hand, is built with privacy as its core principle. Here’s how it compares:

## How SearXNG Works

2. **Query Distribution:** SearXNG sends your query to multiple search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo).
3. **Result Aggregation:** Results from all sources are combined and displayed.
4. **Privacy Protection:** Your IP address and search terms are never shared with the search engines.
