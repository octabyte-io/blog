## What is Pixelfed?  

Pixelfed is an open-source, decentralized image-sharing platform designed to provide a privacy-focused alternative to centralized social media giants like Instagram. Built on the **ActivityPub protocol**, Pixelfed allows users to share photos, follow others, and interact with content across a federated network of servers.  

Unlike traditional platforms, Pixelfed doesn’t rely on a single central server. Instead, it operates on a decentralized model, giving users more control over their data and reducing the risk of censorship.
