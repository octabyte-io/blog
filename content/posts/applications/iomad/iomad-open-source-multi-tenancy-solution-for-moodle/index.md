## What is IOMAD?  

IOMAD (Institutional Open Moodle Admin Distribution) is an open-source extension of Moodle that adds multi-tenancy capabilities. It allows organizations to manage multiple departments, clients, or subsidiaries under a single Moodle instance. Each tenant (organization or department) gets its own dedicated space with customizable branding, user management, and reporting.  

Whether you’re an enterprise managing multiple teams or an e-learning provider serving multiple clients, IOMAD simplifies the process by centralizing management while maintaining individual autonomy for each tenant.
