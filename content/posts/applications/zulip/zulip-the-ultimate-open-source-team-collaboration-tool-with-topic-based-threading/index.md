## What is Zulip?

Zulip is an open-source team chat and collaboration platform designed to make communication more organized and efficient. Unlike traditional chat tools, Zulip introduces **topic-based threading**, which allows users to categorize messages into specific topics within a stream (similar to channels in other tools). This unique approach ensures that conversations remain focused, searchable, and clutter-free.

### Key Features of Zulip

1. **Topic-Based Threading**  
   Every message in Zulip is assigned to a topic, making it easy to follow conversations and find relevant information later. This eliminates the chaos of endless message threads in other tools.

2. **Open-Source and Self-Hosted**  
   Zulip is 100% open-source, giving you full control over your data and the ability to customize the platform to suit your needs. It’s also self-hosted, making it ideal for organizations with strict data privacy requirements.

3. **Powerful Search**  
   Zulip’s advanced search functionality allows you to quickly find messages, files, and links by topic, sender, or date.

4. **Integrations**  
   Zulip integrates seamlessly with popular tools like GitHub, Jira, and Trello, ensuring smooth workflows across platforms.

5. **Cross-Platform Support**  
   Access Zulip on the web, desktop, or mobile, ensuring you stay connected no matter where you are.

6. **Customizable Notifications**  
   Tailor your notification settings to avoid distractions while staying informed about important updates.
