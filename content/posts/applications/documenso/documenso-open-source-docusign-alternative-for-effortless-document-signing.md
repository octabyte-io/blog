In today’s fast-paced digital world, signing documents electronically has become a necessity for businesses and individuals alike. While DocuSign has long been the go-to solution for e-signatures, many are now turning to open-source alternatives like **Documenso** for greater flexibility, security, and cost-effectiveness. In this blog post, we’ll explore what makes Documenso a standout choice and how OctaByte can help you deploy and manage it effortlessly.

## What is Documenso?

Documenso is an open-source document signing platform that provides a secure, customizable, and user-friendly alternative to proprietary solutions like DocuSign.
