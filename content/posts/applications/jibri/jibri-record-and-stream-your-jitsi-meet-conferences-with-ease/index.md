## Introduction

Jitsi Meet is a popular open-source video conferencing solution, widely used for secure and scalable meetings. However, when it comes to recording or live streaming these meetings, Jitsi relies on **Jibri**, an essential component that enables recording and broadcasting via platforms like YouTube Live.

In this blog, we‚Äôll explore **Jibri**, its features, setup process, and how it compares with other video conferencing recording tools.

## What is Jibri?

**Jibri (Jitsi Broadcasting Infrastructure)** is an open-source solution designed to work alongside **Jitsi Meet** to enable:

- **Recording** meetings for later playback.
- **Live streaming** meetings to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook Live.
- **Automated capture** of video conferences without manual intervention.

Jibri achieves this by utilizing a headless Chrome browser and FFmpeg to capture video and audio streams from a Jitsi conference.

## How Jibri Works

Jibri operates as a separate server instance alongside Jitsi Meet. When a user initiates recording or streaming, Jibri joins the Jitsi Meet room as a hidden participant. It then captures the screen, encodes the video using **FFmpeg**, and either saves it to disk or streams it to the desired platform.

### Technical Requirements:
- **Ubuntu 20.04+**
- **Jitsi Meet instance running**
- **Headless Chrome & FFmpeg installed**
- **Xorg & Pulseaudio for handling virtual displays and audio**
- **Adequate CPU & RAM** (e.g., at least 4 CPU cores & 8GB RAM for smooth operation)

## Setting Up Jibri

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg xserver-xorg-core x11-xserver-utils
```

### Step 2: Install and Configure Jibri
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitsi/jibri.git
cd jibri
./install.sh
```

### Step 3: Configure Jibri for Jitsi Meet
Modify the **/etc/jitsi/jibri/config.json** file to match your Jitsi Meet server‚Äôs details.

### Step 4: Start Jibri Service
```bash
sudo systemctl start jibri
sudo systemctl enable jibri
```

Once configured, users can start recording directly from the Jitsi Meet interface.
