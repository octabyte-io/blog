## Why Choose Twenty Over Salesforce?

While Salesforce is a powerful CRM tool, it comes with significant drawbacks, especially for smaller businesses or those with limited budgets. Here’s why Twenty stands out as a compelling alternative:

1. **Cost Savings:** Salesforce’s pricing can be prohibitive for many businesses. Twenty, being open-source, is free to use, with costs primarily associated with hosting and customization.
2. **Flexibility:** Twenty’s open-source nature allows for unlimited customization, whereas Salesforce often requires expensive add-ons or developer support for similar functionality.
3. **Data Control:** With Twenty, you own your data. Salesforce, on the other hand, stores your data on their servers, which can raise concerns about data privacy and security.
4. **Ease of Use:** Twenty’s user-friendly interface makes it easier for teams to get started, reducing the learning curve compared to Salesforce’s complex setup.
