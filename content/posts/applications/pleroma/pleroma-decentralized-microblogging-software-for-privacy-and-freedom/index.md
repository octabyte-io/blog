In today’s digital age, privacy and freedom are becoming increasingly important. Centralized social media platforms often compromise user data and limit freedom of expression. Enter **Pleroma**, a decentralized microblogging software that empowers users to take control of their online presence. In this blog post, we’ll explore what makes Pleroma unique, its key features, and how it compares to other social media platforms.

## What is Pleroma?

Pleroma is an open-source, decentralized microblogging platform built on the **ActivityPub protocol**. It allows users to create and share content in a federated network, meaning you can interact with users on other platforms like Mastodon, PeerTube, and more. Unlike traditional social media, Pleroma is self-hosted, giving users full control over their data and privacy.

### Key Features of Pleroma

1. **Decentralization:**  
   Pleroma operates on a federated network, meaning there’s no central authority controlling the platform. This ensures freedom of expression and reduces the risk of censorship.

2. **Privacy-Focused:**  
   With Pleroma, you own your data. The platform doesn’t track or sell user information, making it a great choice for privacy-conscious individuals.

3. **Lightweight and Efficient:**  
   Pleroma is designed to be lightweight, requiring fewer server resources compared to other platforms like Mastodon. This makes it ideal for self-hosting on smaller servers.

4. **Customizable:**  
   Pleroma offers extensive customization options, allowing users to tailor their experience with themes, plugins, and more.

5. **Interoperability:**  
   Thanks to the ActivityPub protocol, Pleroma users can interact with other federated platforms, expanding their social network beyond just Pleroma instances.

6. **Moderation Tools:**  
   Pleroma provides robust moderation tools, making it easier for instance administrators to maintain a safe and welcoming community.
