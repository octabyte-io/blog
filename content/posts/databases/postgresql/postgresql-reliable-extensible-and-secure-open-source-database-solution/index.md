PostgreSQL, often referred to as "Postgres," is an advanced open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It has been in development for over 30 years and is known for its:

- **Reliability:** PostgreSQL is ACID-compliant, ensuring data integrity and consistency even in high-transaction environments.
- **Extensibility:** With support for custom functions, data types, and extensions, PostgreSQL can be tailored to meet specific business needs.
- **Security:** Features like row-level security, SSL encryption, and robust access controls make PostgreSQL one of the most secure database solutions available.
