## What is Yopass?

Yopass is an open-source, secure secret-sharing tool designed to help users share sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or confidential data securely. It encrypts the shared data and provides a unique link that self-destructs after a single use or after a set expiration time. This ensures that your sensitive information remains private and secure, even when shared over unsecured channels.

Yopass is particularly useful for teams, developers, and businesses that need to share confidential information without risking exposure. Its simplicity and security make it a go-to solution for secure communication.
