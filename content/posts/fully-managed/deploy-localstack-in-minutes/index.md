## What is LocalStack?

LocalStack is an open-source tool that provides a fully functional local AWS cloud stack. It allows developers to test their cloud applications locally without needing to connect to the actual AWS cloud. LocalStack emulates most AWS services, including S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, SQS, and more, making it an invaluable tool for development and testing.

## Why is LocalStack Useful?

1. **Local Development:** Test your AWS applications locally without incurring cloud costs.
2. **Faster Iterations:** Speed up development cycles by eliminating the need to deploy to the cloud for every change.
