## What is Vaultwarden?

Vaultwarden is a lightweight, open-source password manager that is compatible with the Bitwarden API. It allows you to securely store and manage your passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive information. Vaultwarden is an excellent alternative to Bitwarden for those who prefer self-hosting their password manager while maintaining the same level of security and functionality.

### Why Use Vaultwarden?

- **Enhanced Security:** Keep your sensitive data encrypted and stored on your own server.
- **Self-Hosting:** Maintain full control over your data by hosting it on your infrastructure.
- **Lightweight:** Vaultwarden is resource-efficient, making it ideal for small to medium-sized deployments.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Access your passwords from any device using the Bitwarden clients.
