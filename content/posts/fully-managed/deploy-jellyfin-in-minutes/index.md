## What is Jellyfin?

Jellyfin is a free, open-source media server that allows you to organize, stream, and share your media library—movies, TV shows, music, photos, and more—across all your devices. It’s a powerful alternative to proprietary media servers like Plex or Emby, offering full control over your data without any subscription fees or hidden costs.

With Jellyfin, you can:
- Stream your media to any device, anywhere.
- Create personalized user profiles for family and friends.
- Enjoy advanced features like live TV, DVR, and plugins for extended functionality.

## Why Use Jellyfin?

Jellyfin is perfect for media enthusiasts who want complete control over their media library. Unlike other media servers, Jellyfin is entirely open-source, meaning no vendor lock-in or premium features behind paywalls. It’s highly customizable, secure, and privacy-focused, making it an ideal choice for individuals and businesses alike.

However, deploying and managing Jellyfin can be challenging, especially if you lack technical expertise. That’s where OctaByte.io comes in.
