## What is Penpot?

[Penpot](https://penpot.app/) is a powerful open-source design and prototyping tool tailored for designers and developers.

Unlike other design tools, Penpot is free, open-source, and built with web standards, making it highly accessible and customizable.

With Penpot, teams can work together in real-time, share feedback, and export designs seamlessly. It’s an excellent alternative to proprietary tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD, especially for organizations looking for cost-effective and flexible solutions.
