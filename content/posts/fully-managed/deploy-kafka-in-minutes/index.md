## What is Kafka?

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to handle real-time data feeds with high throughput, scalability, and fault tolerance. It’s widely used for building real-time data pipelines, streaming analytics, and event-driven applications. Kafka acts as a central nervous system for modern data architectures, enabling seamless communication between systems and applications.

### Why is Kafka Useful?

- **Scalability:** Kafka can handle massive volumes of data, making it suitable for enterprises of all sizes.  
- **Fault Tolerance:** With built-in replication and partitioning, Kafka ensures data reliability and availability.  
- **Integration:** Kafka integrates seamlessly with popular data tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Elasticsearch.
