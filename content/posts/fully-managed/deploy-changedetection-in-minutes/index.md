## What is ChangeDetection?

ChangeDetection is an open-source tool designed to monitor websites for changes and notify users when updates occur. Whether you're tracking price changes, news updates, or content modifications, ChangeDetection ensures you never miss a critical update. It’s a versatile solution for businesses, developers, and individuals who need to stay informed about changes on specific web pages.

## Why is ChangeDetection Useful?

In today’s fast-paced digital world, staying updated with website changes is crucial for various reasons:
