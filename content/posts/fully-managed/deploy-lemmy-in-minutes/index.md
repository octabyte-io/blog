## What is Lemmy?

[Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/) is a federated link aggregator and discussion platform, similar to Reddit, but decentralized. Built on the ActivityPub protocol, Lemmy allows users to create communities, share links, and engage in discussions across multiple instances. Unlike traditional platforms, Lemmy is open-source, privacy-focused, and community-driven, making it an excellent choice for those who value decentralization and control over their data.
