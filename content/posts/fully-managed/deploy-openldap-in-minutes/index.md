## What is OpenLDAP?  

OpenLDAP is an open-source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a widely used protocol for accessing and managing directory information services.

OpenLDAP is highly scalable, flexible, and secure, making it a popular choice for businesses of all sizes. Whether you’re managing a small team or a large enterprise, OpenLDAP ensures seamless user management and secure access to resources.
