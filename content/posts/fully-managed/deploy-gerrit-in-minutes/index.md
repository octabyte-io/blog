## What is Gerrit?

Gerrit is a web-based code review and collaboration tool designed for Git-based projects. It is widely used by development teams to streamline the code review process, ensuring high-quality code and efficient collaboration. Gerrit provides a robust platform for managing code changes, enabling developers to review, comment, and approve code before it is merged into the main repository.

## Why Use Gerrit?

- **Enhanced Code Quality:** Gerrit's code review process ensures that every change is thoroughly reviewed, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving overall code quality.
- **Collaboration:** Gerrit facilitates seamless collaboration among team members, allowing for real-time feedback and discussions on code changes.
- **Integration:** Gerrit integrates well with other development tools, making it a versatile choice for modern software development workflows.
