## What is GitLab?

GitLab is a powerful, open-source DevOps platform that provides a complete suite of tools for software development, version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management. It’s widely used by development teams to streamline workflows, collaborate effectively, and deliver high-quality software faster.

Whether you're managing a small team or a large enterprise, GitLab offers features like code repositories, issue tracking, automated testing, and deployment pipelines—all in one unified platform.
