## What is Directus?

Directus is an open-source **headless CMS** (Content Management System) designed to provide a flexible and scalable solution for managing content across various platforms. Unlike traditional CMS platforms, Directus is database-first, meaning it connects directly to your SQL database, offering full control over your data structure and content. It’s perfect for developers and businesses looking for a customizable, API-driven CMS that can adapt to their unique needs.

Directus is widely used for building websites, mobile apps, and other digital experiences. Its intuitive interface, REST and GraphQL APIs, and extensible architecture make it a favorite among developers and content creators alike.
