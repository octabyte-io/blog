## What is Cryptgeon?

Cryptgeon is an open-source, self-hosted secret-sharing tool designed to securely share sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or confidential messages. Built with privacy in mind, Cryptgeon ensures that your data is encrypted and accessible only to those with the correct link. Once the secret is retrieved or the expiration time is reached, the data is permanently deleted, leaving no trace behind.

Cryptgeon is ideal for businesses, developers, and individuals who prioritize security and privacy when sharing sensitive information. Whether you're collaborating with a remote team or sharing credentials with a client, Cryptgeon provides a reliable and secure solution.
