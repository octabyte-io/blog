## What is Apache Guacamole?

Apache Guacamole is a **clientless remote desktop gateway** that allows users to access their systems from anywhere using just a web browser. No plugins or software installations are required on the client side, making it a versatile and secure solution for remote access. Guacamole supports standard protocols like RDP, VNC, and SSH, enabling seamless connections to Windows, Linux, and other systems.

## Why is Guacamole Useful?

1. **Clientless Access:** Access your systems from any device with a web browser—no need for additional software or plugins.
2. **Cross-Platform Support:** Connect to Windows, Linux, and other systems using RDP, VNC, or SSH.
3. **Centralized Management:** Manage all your remote connections from a single, secure web interface.
