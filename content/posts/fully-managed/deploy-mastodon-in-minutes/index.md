## What is Mastodon?

Mastodon is an open-source, decentralized social networking platform that offers an alternative to traditional social media giants. Unlike centralized platforms, Mastodon operates on a federated network of independent servers, giving users more control over their data and privacy. With features like customizable timelines, moderation tools, and no ads, Mastodon is gaining popularity among individuals and communities seeking a more transparent and user-centric social media experience.

## Why Use Mastodon?

- **Decentralization:** Mastodon’s federated structure ensures no single entity controls the network, promoting freedom of expression and reducing censorship.
- **Privacy-Focused:** With no ads or data mining, Mastodon prioritizes user privacy and security.
- **Customizable:** Users can tailor their experience with unique server rules, themes, and moderation policies.
- **Community-Driven:** Mastodon fosters niche communities, making it ideal for groups with shared interests.
