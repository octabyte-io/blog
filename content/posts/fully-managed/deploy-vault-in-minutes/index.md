## What is HashiCorp Vault?

HashiCorp Vault is a widely-used open-source tool designed for securely storing, accessing, and managing sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys. It provides a centralized platform for secrets management, ensuring that your sensitive information is protected and accessible only to authorized users and applications.

Vault is particularly useful for organizations that need to manage secrets across multiple environments, enforce access control policies, and maintain compliance with security standards. However, deploying and managing Vault can be complex and time-consuming, especially for teams without specialized expertise.
