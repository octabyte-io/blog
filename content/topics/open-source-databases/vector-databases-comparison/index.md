## Why Vector Databases Matter for AI & ML

Vector databases are the backbone of **AI-powered search, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications**. Instead of matching exact values like traditional databases (e.g., [PostgreSQL](https://octabyte.io/fully-managed-open-source-services/databases/relational-databases/postgresql) or [MySQL](https://octabyte.io/fully-managed-open-source-services/databases/relational-databases/mysql)), they handle **vector embeddings** — numerical representations of text, images, or audio.  

This enables:  
- **Semantic search** (finding meaning, not keywords)  
- **Recommendation systems**  
- **Multimodal AI (text, images, audio combined)**  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for LLMs  

If you’re building **AI-driven apps**, choosing the right vector database is as important as picking the right LLM.
