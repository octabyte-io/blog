## What is SurrealDB?

SurrealDB is a **next-generation open-source multi-model database** that supports SQL, document, graph, and key-value data — all within a single engine. Unlike traditional databases that lock you into one model, SurrealDB lets developers handle multiple data types seamlessly, making it a flexible choice for modern applications.

---

## Why SurrealDB is Gaining Attention

Databases have always been about trade-offs: relational systems like [PostgreSQL](https://octabyte.io/fully-managed-open-source-services/databases/relational-databases/postgresql) offer strong consistency, while document stores like [MongoDB alternatives such as FerretDB](/topics/open-source-databases/ferretdb-mongodb-alternative/) focus on flexibility.

SurrealDB challenges this model by offering:

* **SQL + NoSQL Hybrid:** Supports traditional SQL queries and schema-less data.
* **Multi-Model Power:** Document, graph, and relational data combined in one engine.
* **Cloud-Native & Serverless Ready:** Built for distributed, edge, and modern app deployments.
* **Security First:** Built-in authentication, row-level permissions, and encryption.

In short: SurrealDB isn’t just another NoSQL option — it’s an **all-in-one database** for developers tired of juggling multiple systems.
