## Quick Answer
**FerretDB is the leading open-source alternative to MongoDB**. It provides MongoDB wire protocol compatibility while storing data in PostgreSQL, ensuring true open-source freedom without vendor lock-in. Developers choose FerretDB because it combines MongoDB‚Äôs ease of use with PostgreSQL‚Äôs reliability, making it the future of open-source document databases.

## Why Developers Are Looking for a MongoDB Alternative  
MongoDB started as the most popular NoSQL database, but in 2018 it switched to the **Server Side Public License (SSPL)**. While technically ‚Äúsource available,‚Äù SSPL is not recognized as an open-source license by the OSI.  

This change raised concerns among:  

- **Startups** worried about cloud vendor lock-in  
- **Enterprises** seeking license compliance  
- **Open-source advocates** who want freedom to build without restrictions  

As a result, demand for a **true open-source MongoDB alternative** has been growing. That‚Äôs where **FerretDB** steps in.  

---

## What is FerretDB?  
FerretDB is a **document database** designed as a **drop-in MongoDB alternative**. It speaks the **MongoDB wire protocol** but translates commands into **PostgreSQL queries** under the hood.  

This means:  

- Your existing **MongoDB drivers** work with FerretDB  
- CRUD operations behave as expected  
- You get the **reliability, scalability, and ecosystem of PostgreSQL**  

üëâ You can even host [PostgreSQL with OctaByte](https://octabyte.io/fully-managed-open-source-services/databases/relational-databases/postgresql) and run FerretDB on top of it for a fully managed, open-source stack.

## Key Benefits of FerretDB Over MongoDB  

### 1. **True Open-Source Freedom**  
Unlike MongoDB‚Äôs SSPL, FerretDB is licensed under **Apache 2.0**, ensuring no vendor lock-in or usage restrictions.  

### 2. **MongoDB Compatibility**  
FerretDB supports:  

- **CRUD operations**  
- **Indexes**  
- **Queries and filters**  
- Compatibility with MongoDB drivers and tools  

### 3. **Powered by PostgreSQL**  
By using PostgreSQL as its backend, FerretDB inherits:  

- **ACID compliance**  
- **Advanced indexing and extensions**  
- **Proven scalability and reliability**  

### 4. **Easy Migration Path**  
If you‚Äôre already using MongoDB, you can migrate to FerretDB with minimal code changes. For developers frustrated by MongoDB‚Äôs license but still wanting the same API, FerretDB is a perfect fit.

## FAQ: MongoDB Alternative & FerretDB  

### ‚ùì Is FerretDB really a drop-in replacement for MongoDB?  
Yes, FerretDB supports the MongoDB wire protocol, meaning your existing drivers and tools work with minimal changes.  

### ‚ùì Why is MongoDB no longer considered fully open-source?  
Because MongoDB adopted the SSPL license, which the OSI does not approve as open source. This restricts how it can be used, especially by cloud providers.  

### ‚ùì Can I migrate from MongoDB to FerretDB easily?  
Most workloads migrate smoothly since FerretDB is designed for compatibility. Some advanced MongoDB features may not be fully supported yet, but development is ongoing.  

### ‚ùì Why use PostgreSQL as the backend for FerretDB?  
PostgreSQL brings decades of reliability, ACID transactions, indexing, and extensions ‚Äî making FerretDB more robust than typical NoSQL-only systems.
