## Why Databases Matter for AI & ML

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning workloads aren‚Äôt just about models ‚Äî **data is the fuel**. From embeddings used in generative AI to historical time-series for predictive analytics, databases form the backbone of training and inference pipelines.

Unlike traditional apps, AI workloads require:

- **Scalability** for huge datasets (billions of rows or vectors)  
- **Low latency** for real-time predictions and recommendations  
- **Specialized queries** like similarity search, graph traversal, or anomaly detection  
- **Flexibility** to store unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data  

That‚Äôs why choosing the right **open-source database** is critical.
